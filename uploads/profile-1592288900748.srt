This is a story of boy meets girl.

The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey...

6
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,642

that he'd never truly be happy...

until the day he met "the one. “

This belief stemmed from early exposure
to sad British pop music...

[Narrator] For Tom Hansen,
this was the night where everything changed.

628
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:43,216
That wall Summer so often hid behind...

629
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,848
the wall of distance, of space, of casual...

630
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,125
that wall was slowly coming down.

631
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,928
For here was Tom, in her world...

632
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:59,435
a place few had been invited to see
with their own eyes.

633
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,767
And here was Summer, wanting him there.

634
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,602
Him, no one else.

- No.

- I have that too!
- You do?

638
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,217
Yeah! It's so weird.
It's like being an old man.

639
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,050
[Chuckles]
What else do you have?

640
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,181
Um, earthquakes?

641
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,522

- No.

[Summer]
You know, I dream sometimes about flying.

644
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:34,304
It starts out like I'm running really, really fast.

645
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,305
I'm, like, superhuman.

646
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:39,706
And the terrain starts
to get really rocky and steep.

647
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,576
And then I'm running so fast
that my feet aren't even touching the ground.

648
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:48,277
And I'm floating,
and it's like this amazing, amazing realness.

649
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,117
I'm free. I'm safe.

650
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,056
Then I realize...

651
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,787
I'm completely alone.

652
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,233
And then I wake up.

653
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,302
[Narrator]
As he listened, Tom began to realize...

654
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,839
that these weren't stories routinely told.

655
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:12,272
- These were stories one had to earn.

He could feel the wall coming down.

657
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,745
He wondered if anyone else
had made it this far.

658
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:22,808
Which is why the next six words
changed everything.

I've never told anybody that before.

We know how we feel.

666

- Yeah, I know what you mean.

That's what happened between me and Sean.
